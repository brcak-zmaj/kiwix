About
--------
This repository is dedicated to providing a simple and automated way to deploy the Kiwix server using Docker. It is created out of a deep passion for data archiving and preserving knowledge in a manner that can reach even the most remote corners of the world. In an era where access to information is crucial, I believe in the mission of the Kiwix project to bring the internet and its vast reservoir of knowledge to places that don't have it.
